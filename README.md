# 🛍️ GreenRetail – Smarter, Greener Shopping

GreenRetail is a sustainability-focused platform that empowers shoppers to make eco-conscious purchase decisions by providing real-time environmental impact scores (GreenScores) for products across e-commerce websites.

We also provide a simple dashboard for retailers to upload product sustainability data, which is analyzed by our ML model to generate a reliable GreenScore.

3. Chrome extension detects products on platforms like Meesho/Amazon and shows scores.
4. Shoppers see badges and popups to guide sustainable choices in real time.
